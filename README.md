# Noise-and-Complexity

My inspiration for this project was temporary art. Due to the nature of randomness it is nearly impossible for the exact same thing to be made twice. I decided to lean into this idea and create a psuedo-random drawing function that would give the user a randomized brush consisting of many different agents that leave a trail behind. The agents are also attatched to a sin wave further diluting the user's control. Whether you try to control the brush or just let it draw something it is bound to make something that looks interesting. To incentivize letting go of control I added a black hole that will destroy the ever-changing work after a set amount of time, but I removed this because I didn't like it.
